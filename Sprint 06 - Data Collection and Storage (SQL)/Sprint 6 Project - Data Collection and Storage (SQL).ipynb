    " **Overall Summary of the Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear Paul,\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing your data analysis project for Zuber! Your notebook is well-organized and provides a comprehensive analysis of taxi ride patterns in Chicago. You've effectively structured your project with clear sections, detailed explanations, and appropriate visualizations. Your work demonstrates a strong understanding of data manipulation, visualization, and statistical hypothesis testing. Below is some feedback to help you refine your project according to the assessment criteria.\n",

    "<div style=\"border-left: 7px solid green; padding: 10px;\">\n",
    "<b>✅ Strengths:</b>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><b>Data Loading and Preparation:</b> You efficiently loaded the datasets and performed necessary data cleaning, including handling company names with extra numbers. Your use of regular expressions to clean the data shows proficiency in data preprocessing.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Exploratory Data Analysis:</b> You conducted thorough EDA by analyzing the distribution of rides among taxi companies and identifying the top neighborhoods by drop-offs. Your visualizations effectively highlight key insights, such as the dominance of certain companies and neighborhoods.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Visualization Skills:</b> The bar charts and pie charts are well-designed, with appropriate labels and titles. Filtering companies with fewer than 200 rides to reduce visual clutter demonstrates good analytical judgment.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Hypothesis Formulation:</b> You clearly stated both the null and alternative hypotheses, which is essential for proper hypothesis testing.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Your summary effectively ties together the findings from your analysis, providing valuable insights into taxi company performance, neighborhood popularity, and the impact of weather on ride durations.</li>\n",

    "  <li><b>Code Comments:</b> Including comments within your code cells to explain the purpose of each code block can enhance readability and help others understand your thought process.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Data Type Conversion:</b> While you mentioned that data types appear correct, explicitly verifying and documenting the data types of your columns can strengthen your data validation process.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Enhanced Visualizations:</b> Consider adding more descriptive titles or annotations to your graphs to provide additional context and make your visualizations more informative.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>Formatting:</b> Ensure consistent formatting throughout your notebook, such as consistent use of headings and spacing, to improve overall readability.</li>\n",

    "Your project demonstrates a solid understanding of data analysis techniques and provides valuable insights into the taxi industry in Chicago. By addressing the critical changes regarding the correct day for hypothesis testing, you will align your analysis with the project requirements and strengthen your findings. Enhancing code documentation and refining visualizations will further improve the clarity and impact of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjust Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "  - Modify your data filtering to focus on rides that occurred on rainy Sundays.\n",
    "  - Update your hypotheses and re-run the statistical tests accordingly.\n",
    "  - Interpret the new results and discuss their implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhance Code Documentation:**\n",
    "  - Add comments within your code cells to explain the purpose and functionality of each code block.\n",
    "  - This will make your code more readable and easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refine Visualizations:**\n",
    "  - Add more context to your graphs with descriptive titles and annotations.\n",
    "  - Ensure that all labels are clear and that the visualizations effectively communicate your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verify Data Types Explicitly:**\n",
    "  - Include code to check and, if necessary, convert data types to ensure consistency and correctness.\n",

    "**(Response)** Thanks for the feedback! I believe this project should have been accepted as is for the below reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "- I provided a good amount of code documentation and am not entirely sure what else can be added, so if you could provide some examples that would be great.\n",
    "- I would say the same thing about formatting - what about it specifically isn't consistent? I'm using headings, subheadings, bullet lists, and so forth whenever possible to improve readability. \n",
    "- Also, there isn't really much more that can be added to label my graphs - my labels are very complete and contain all necessary details (dates, places, etc.) with proper sizing and readability.\n",
    "- Finally, the instructions say to use Saturdays for my hypothesis - I can make the change to Sunday still but that isn't what I was originally instructed to do. I double checked and all possible sets of instructions all say Saturday (within jupyterhub as well as at the start of the sprint).\n",

    "- **Taxi Companies**\n",
    "    - Flash Cab is the dominant taxi company with a 14.2% market share.\n",
    "    - Taxi Affiliation Services fulfilled the second most rides, with a, 8.3% share.\n",
    "    - About 10 other competitors are providing at least 5000 rides in this time period.\n",
    "    - There are a total of 64 taxi companies in the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Chicago Neighborhood Popularity**\n",
    "    - The top 3 destination neighborhoods are Loop, River North, and Streeterville.\n",
    "    - These 3 neighborhoods account for 47.7% of all Chicago dropoffs, and 62.2% among the top 10 neighborhoods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Effect of Weather**\n",
    "    - For rides from Loop to O'Hare International Airport, weather rated 'bad' causes a statistically significant change in ride duration (α = 0.05).\n",
    "    - The average change in ride duration in 'bad' weather was an increase of over 7 minutes."
